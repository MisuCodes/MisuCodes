### Hi there, I'm Misu! ✨

I'm a self-taught aspiring **Backend Developer** from Venezuela, and my story is anything but ordinary.

Since I was little, I've always loved technology. I even started learning basic programming back in high school. But math was tough for me, and after several failed semesters, I ended up following my second passion: languages. I graduated with a degree in Modern Languages from Unimar.

But in **2025**, I made myself a promise: *I would go back to my original dream.* I returned to programming with a full heart, ready to learn everything I once thought I couldn’t. I'm currently taking CS50, starting with Scratch, and slowly building a foundation that will take me where I want to go: the backend world ✨

#### About me:
- 🌟 I'm **curious**, **resilient**, and I never give up—if I set a goal, I reach it (no matter how long it takes).
- ☕ I study by hand-writing notes, watching YouTube videos, and diving into a list of tech books I've picked for myself.
- 🧰 I'm obsessed with learning all things **backend**—from Python to databases to server logic and beyond.
- 🌺 I love cats (especially my Misu!), baking sweets, anime, cozy aesthetics, and relaxing music.
- 🎧 Currently vibing to: NewJeans, Olivia Rodrigo, and Sabrina Carpenter.

#### Why "Misu"?
"Misu" is more than just a nickname—it's my world. It's the name of my cat, who came into my life shortly after my grandfather passed away. She became the calming presence in our home, the one who soothed our arguments and brought peace when we needed it most. She's over 15 now, and means the world to me. Since then, I've used her name online as a tribute and a reminder of who I am, and the space I've built from love and resilience.

#### ✨ My goal:
To become the **best backend developer** I can possibly be—maybe even the best in my country. I'm just getting started, but I know where I'm going, and I'm giving it everything I’ve got.

> "The brightest star shines in the darkest night."

> I carry this phrase with me because it feels like it was written just for me. Through all the darkness in my life and environment, I've always wanted to shine, to learn, and to be seen—not as ordinary, but as someone who never gave up.
